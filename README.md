# Repeat Bot

Repeat bot is a simple Discord bot that repeats a message sent by a specified user. Its built using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).
To complile the code into an exe, run `yarn` to install dependencies, then run `yarn build`.
You can also run the bot with `yarn dev`, but this will recopile the code every time.


* To get the bot setup, first create an application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
* Then add the bot to your application by clicking on the "Add Bot" button under the bot section.
* Then click "copy token" (you may need to regenerate it first).
* Once you have copied the token, paste it into the console when prompted.
* To get the user's ID, follow [this](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) article and paste it in the console when prompted.
* If you want to change the token after the first run, you can either go into the `config.json` file created and edit the token or delete the config file to begin the prompting process again.
* The `config.json` file will be located where you ran the script/executable from.
